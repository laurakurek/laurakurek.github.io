## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate advised by [Ceren Budak](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/ceren-budak) and [Eric Gilbert](http://eegilbert.org/) at the University of Michigan in the School of Information. I research information manipulation on the internet using both quantitative and qualitative methods. I work with data from social media platforms (X/Twitter, Rumble, Telegram) as well as peer-production knowledge sites (Wikipedia).

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked in industry for several years as a data science specialist at Accenture Federal Services. In 2017, I spent a year in the Ural Mountains on a Fulbright Scholarship.
